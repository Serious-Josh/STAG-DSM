Key training settings:

-Arcface:
  Scale: 15
  Margin: 0.25

-Generic:
  LR: Adam with 3e-4
  Epochs: 15

-DMD:
  80 frame cap per annotated action
  Max 1500 frames per video
  LR: AdamW with 1e-4(head-only) and 1e-5(unfreeze)
  Epochs: 15 total (3 head-only, 12 unfreeze)


Important choices:

-Model doesn't actually directly detect fatigue directly. The model makes inference based on the dmd classes, then later in application implementation
  a binary mapping (0=no fatigue, 1=fatigue) needs to be created. For example (not actual mapping): classes 1-9 = 0 (no fatigue), classes 10-17 = 1 (fatigue) (NOT REAL MAPPINGS).
  Seems counterintuitive but helps allow flexibility so you can change mappings based on real experience later on.
